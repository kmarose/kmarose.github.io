career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Interests in computers and Japan have lead me to a career in Japan for over a decade.  
      While my primary training is software development, I have done a little bit of everything.  
      I've managed large projects, but always like getting my hands dirty fixing problems.  
      Sometimes I'm fixing an incident in prod, others editing a video, or translating for the CEO.  
      On the side I volunteer at my church, and have even done a little bit of modelling.  
      Ultimately I strive to combine my bilingual ability with my technical skills.
